<h3 align="left">Task 1:</h3>
<h4 align="left">Iris Flowers Classification ML Project</h4>
<h4 align="left">This is perhaps the best-known example in the field of machine learning.The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) from sepals' and petals' length and width measurements. The iris data set contains fifty instances of each of the three species. The central goal here is to design a model that makes useful classifications for new flowers.

<h3 align="left">Task 2:</h3>
<h4 align="left">Image to Pencil Sketch with Python</h4>
<h4 align="left">We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a pencil sketch image through process of grayscaling, inverting, blurring and using the divide function to get the final image. We require cv2 library in python to perform various functions on the image.The link to project in available <a href="_TASK2.ipynb">click here.</a></h4>

<h3 align="left">Task 3:</h3>
<h4 align="left">Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism</h4>
<h4 align="left">According to a survey, about 218 million people are affected by calamities, natural and man-made, per annum and about 68000 people loose their lives every year. The frequency of natural disasters have remained broadly constant, but the number of terrorist activities have grown over the period. The aim of this task is to explore the terrorist events around the world. Plots and Graphs are used in this task, for making the exploration easy and more informative.

<h3 align="left">Task 4:</h3>
<h4 align="left">Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm</h4>
<h4 align="left">Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose of creating this model is that if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
